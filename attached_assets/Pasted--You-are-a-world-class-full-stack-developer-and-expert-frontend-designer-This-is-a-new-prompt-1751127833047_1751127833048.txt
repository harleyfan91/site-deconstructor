**You are a world‑class full‑stack developer and expert frontend designer.**

This is a **new prompt** to refine the existing colour‑extraction feature with two enhancements:

---

## 1  Backend – simple harmony ordering

Without altering how colours are bucketed, update the extraction code so that within each bucket the colours are **sorted** by hue (HSL) in ascending order (i.e. 0°→360°).

* **Locate** the array of colour objects in `server/lib/color-extraction.ts` (or the file where the API assembles its JSON response).
* **After** names and hex codes are computed, but **before** returning JSON, inject a sort step using your existing `colord` import:

  ```ts
  // given colors: Array<{ hex: string; name: string; property: string; occurrences: number }>
  colors.sort((a, b) => colord(a.hex).toHsl().h - colord(b.hex).toHsl().h);
  ```
* Ensure the sort applies **per-bucket** if grouping happens in the backend; or apply globally and let the frontend re‑group.
* Leave all bucket labels and occurrences intact.

## 2  Frontend – color detail popup

**Ensure that the color chips themselves remain identical in appearance and behavior to the current implementation; only their order will change and they will gain the new popup functionality.**

When a user clicks on any colour chip in the `ColorExtractionCard`, display a modal dialog showing:

1. A full‑width header with the clicked colour as its **background**.
2. The hex code in bold as a title.
3. The human-friendly name (from the API’s `name` field) as a subtitle below.
4. Automatically close the popup when the user clicks anywhere outside of it.

Implementation hints:\*\*

* Create or reuse a Modal component (e.g. MUI `<Dialog>` or similar) in `ColorExtractionCard.tsx` or a new helper.
* Attach an `onClick` handler to each colour chip to set the selected colour in React state and open the modal.
* Pass the selected hex and name into the modal’s props.
* Style the modal header using inline styles or your design system to match the colour.

### Deliverables

* Backend: sorted colours by hue within each bucket.
* Frontend: interactive modal displaying colour details on click.
* No changes to bucket membership or naming.

Good luck!
