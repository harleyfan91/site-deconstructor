he mobile responsiveness issue in the Performance and Security tab may result from various factors, such as CSS styles not adapting well to different screen sizes or missing meta tags. Here are some steps to diagnose and potentially resolve the issue:

Viewport Meta Tag: Ensure that the viewport meta tag is included in your HTML. This is crucial for mobile responsiveness.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Responsive CSS: Check your CSS styles to see if they utilize responsive units (like percentages or viewport-based units) rather than fixed sizes (like pixels). Utilize CSS media queries to apply styles based on screen size.
Flexbox/Grid Layouts: Make sure you're leveraging CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout adjustments. From the provided code snippets, it looks like you're already using Flexbox for alignment (<Box display="flex">). Review if there are any conflicting styles.
Debugging Tools: Use browser developer tools (F12) to simulate various screen sizes and inspect the elements. Check if any specific components do not resize properly.
Mobile Responsiveness Section: In your MobileResponsivenessSection, you manage score retrieval, which should reflect any analysis results accurately. Ensure that the responsiveness logic is implemented correctly. Hereâ€™s a snippet from your existing code that checks mobile performance:
const { score = 0, issues = [] } = data?.mobileResponsiveness || {};
Handling Issues: If there are specific issues detected (like missing viewport tags or CSS) in your mobile responsiveness checks, ensure they are addressed and shown to users dynamically. For example, issues are being rendered here:
{issues.length > 0 ? (
    issues.map((issue, idx) => (
        <Card key={idx} sx={{ mb: 1, backgroundColor: 'warning.light' }}>
            <CardContent sx={{ py: 1.5 }}>
                <Typography variant="subtitle2" color="warning.dark" gutterBottom>
                    {issue.title}
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
                    {issue.description}
                </Typography>
            </CardContent>
        </Card>
    ))
) : (
    <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ fontStyle: 'italic', color: 'text.secondary' }}>
        No mobile issues detected.
    </Typography>
)}
By investigating these points, you can typically identify and correct mobile responsiveness issues in your application. If you continue to experience issues, feel free to ask for more specific troubleshooting!
