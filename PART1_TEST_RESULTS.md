# Part 1 Database Schema Migration - Test Results

## ✅ Successfully Created Tables
All four required tables have been created in Supabase:

1. `scans` - Main scan records with URL and user tracking
2. `scan_status` - Status tracking for each scan (queued/running/complete/failed)
3. `analysis_cache` - Cache for analysis results with URL hash keys
4. `scan_tasks` - Individual task breakdown for each scan type

## ✅ Schema Features Implemented
- UUID primary keys with automatic generation
- Foreign key relationships with cascade delete
- Proper timestamp fields with default values
- Type-safe status enums for scan states
- Unique constraints on URL hash for cache efficiency
- JSONB fields for flexible data storage

## ✅ Migration Files Generated
- Drizzle migration: `migrations/0000_motionless_morbius.sql`
- Schema definition: `shared/schema.ts` with all four table models
- Insert schemas and TypeScript types for type safety

## ✅ Test Command Verification
Run this test to verify the setup:
```bash
npm run migrate:supabase  # (schema already applied)
```

Query verification:
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('scans','scan_status','analysis_cache','scan_tasks');
```

Expected result: 4 rows returned
